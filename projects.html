            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Here, I list some projects and describe why they're useful. You can see all my open-source projects on <a href="https://github.com/savirsingh">my GitHub profile</a>. In reverse chronological order:</p>
            <h3><a href="https://clonioai.guessoword.com">Clonio AI</a> <i>[developed in May 2024]</i></h3>
            <p>This is an LLM tool that allows you to train a chatbot to behave <i>exactly</i> like anyone you talk to online. Simply feed it a past relevant conversation you've had and it will analyze sentiment, punctuation, and more to act and react like the other person when talking to you. Clonio is a useful tool if you want to experience a conversation <i>before</i> actually having it. Some example scenarios include asking your boss for a raise, or asking a recruiter what your chances look like for a job.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://mathcontestrepository.pythonanywhere.com">The Math Contest Repository</a> <i>[developed in October 2023]</i></h3>
            <p>The MCR is a collection of over 1,400 contest-style math problems. The platform is used by over 500 registered students and has hosted 15+ contests so far. Over 5,000 solutions have been submitted to and graded by the judging system. I developed the MCR because as someone who prepares for math contests, I've always wanted an app that can check my answers automatically for me, instead of having to visit a new page and switch tabs constantly. The MCR is also great because it can host mock live contests developed by the community, for the community!</p>
            <h3><a href="https://volcanojudge.pythonanywhere.com">Volcano Judge</a> <i>[developed in October 2022]</i></h3>
            <p>Volcano Judge is a sandboxed online competitive programming platform that I developed in Grade 10. It is similar to LeetCode and Codeforces, and has support for Python and C++. There are three <i>sister judges</i> (or clones) of Volcano Judge for organizations. One was developed for and is used by Garth Webb SS for contests hosted by its CS club.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/savirsingh/bytesense-htn-project">BYTEsense (Hack the North 2023)</a> <i>[developed in September 2023]</i></h3>
            <p>I was accepted into Hack the North 2023 (for their 10th iteration!), Canada's largest and most competitive hackathon, hosted at the University of Waterloo. BYTEsense was a project developed by me along with three other high school teammates during that weekend. BYTEsense is an AI tool that can accurately estimate how you will feel after consuming a meal, based on how you felt after consuming other meals with similar ingredients. We used OpenAI and Cohere APIs and I fully developed the web app and database.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://thatformworks.pythonanywhere.com">Thatformworks</a> <i>[developed in May 2022]</i></h3>
            <p>A simple tool that processes the backend for static HTML contact & reservation forms. It sends an email to an associated email address for the form. I later learned that this already exists in some forms, but it was a fun project nonetheless!</p>
